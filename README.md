# SpeakWithMe - The VR app that teaches Chinese!
Back in April 21-22, 2018, I participated in UCR's CitrusHack with Rick, Xenia, and Karen and created this application. We won 2nd prize for our efforts.

## Overview
I've posted a YouTube video here ([VR Apps: Showing off SpeakWithMe, a Chinese Teaching VR Hackathon App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q91OFmDC08)) which shows the basics of the app. The app was originally designed for Oculus Rift, but I'm planning on converting its API calls to OpenVR (more on this below).

When the app is launched, we immerse the player in an imaginary Chinese-speaking city (let's call it Taiwan since one of my teammates was from Taiwan). The player is asked to look for NPCs all over the city, each one bearing its own set of Chinese lessons: a boy in the park will teach you how to say hello, a police officer nearby will give you directions to the Farmer's market, a vendor woman will teach you the names of food, ~~and the thug near the vendor will teach you mean words~~. The app includes a "Record n' Repeat" feature, where we actually record your attempts at the Chinese words, play it back for you, and give you a chance to hear yourself and try again if you want.

The app only has one level and a small vocabulary list of Chinese words for you to learn (heck, I can't remember if it was Cantonese or Mandarin), but it's a decent ~10 minute experience altogether, including voice recordings.

## Recent Work
Converting API calls from Rift to OpenVR.

I had a strong desire to make some fresh recordings of this application for my
portfolio. Unfortunately, I own a Windows Mixed Reality headset, not an Oculus Rift. 
That means all the VR API calls don't work here. I'm starting to
chuck out all the Oculus code and replace it with OpenVR code, but I'm nowhere
near done yet. I have no solid plans to complete this, but I'd like my progress
documented online just in case I can show this off later.

## Mushy reasons I really like this project
1. Friendship. Working on a team is unique for me, so to do so (for the second time ever in a hackathon) and have it turn out this well, with people this nice? Good memories.
  * Favorite memories: sneaking into an abandoned classroom to record the English and Chinese narrator scripts (see preview here: [VR Apps: Showing off SpeakWithMe, a Chinese Teaching VR Hackathon App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q91OFmDC08)). I got to be the English narrator, which was super exciting.
  * Sleeping for 1 hour at 9:30 am the next day. Karen stayed up with me, though she admits she dozed off when I wasn't looking.
2. Pride. I was earning my M.S. in CompSci with an emphasis in VR at this time, so to earn second place because of a VR app makes me proud.
3. Money. Has to be mentioned.
